# Fibonacci Algorithms in Java

This Java program implements various algorithms for calculating Fibonacci numbers, including recursive, iterative, matrix exponentiation, memoization, Binet's formula, and bottom-up dynamic programming approaches.

## Introduction

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. These algorithms provide different ways to efficiently compute Fibonacci numbers for a given input.

## Usage

To run the program, compile the `Main.java` file and execute the generated `.class` file:

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```

The program will output the execution times of each algorithm for predefined input sizes.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Recursive Approach**: Computes Fibonacci numbers recursively.
- **Iterative Approach**: Computes Fibonacci numbers using a loop.
- **Matrix Exponentiation**: Computes Fibonacci numbers using matrix exponentiation.
- **Memoization**: Computes Fibonacci numbers with memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
- **Binet's Formula**: Computes Fibonacci numbers using Binet's formula.
- **Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming**: Computes Fibonacci numbers using bottom-up dynamic programming.
